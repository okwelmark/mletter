    <h1><b>Subjects of study</b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded resaerch facility - as long as the subjects fall</p>
    <p>in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
    <p>kind of person we"d like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
    <p>are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <br>
    <!--Another list which is ordrered-->
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </p>
    <p>to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <br>
    <h1><b>Exotic dance moves</b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, you are right! as part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</p>
    <p>favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <br>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around </dd>
        <dd>a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelandser developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</dd>
        <dd>involed huddling close together in a cirlce on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</dd>
        <dd>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</dd>
        <dd>modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
        <dt>arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
        <dd>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</dd>
        <dd>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it wa discovered that they were just moving like this</dd>
        <dd>because they were really cold.</dd>    
    </dl>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
    <br>
